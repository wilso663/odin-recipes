            Effortlessly Delicious: Bake Your Way to Joy with our Quick and
            Incredible Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe
          </h3>
          <p>
            Indulge in the ultimate pleasure of a simple yet divine recipe for
            buttery smooth chocolate cookies that melt in your mouth. This
            delightful treat begins with the finest quality ingredients,
            including rich dark chocolate that is expertly chopped into decadent
            morsels. The secret lies in the perfect balance of unsalted butter
            and granulated sugar, creamed together until light and fluffy. The
            addition of pure vanilla extract enhances the flavors, while a touch
            of salt elevates the taste profile. The star of the show is the
            chopped chocolate, meticulously folded into the buttery dough,
            creating pockets of irresistible melty goodness. The dough is then
            scooped and baked to perfection, resulting in heavenly cookies with
            a crispy exterior and a tender, buttery smooth interior. These
            chocolate delights are a testament to the beauty of simplicity and
            the joy that comes from savoring a perfect bite of pure chocolate
            bliss.

        <p>Instructions</p>
        <ol class="recipe__steps">
          <li>
            Whisk flour, pinch of salt, and baking soda. Set aside for later.
          </li>
          <li>Rough chop your chocolate bars into bite sized pieces.</li>
          <li>Melt unsalted butter, don't keep toasting it.</li>
          <li>
            In a stand mixer bowl, add brown sugar, white granulated sugar, and
            turn on the mixer to low.
          </li>
          <li>When combined, add in your butter, then a whole egg.</li>
          <li>
            Turn your mixer up to medium and add in an egg yolk. This is subtle
            but important to get the right texture that holds but still melts in
            your mouth.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add in your vanilla extract. Then carefully add in your flour
            mixture
          </li>
          <li>When thoroughly combined, add in your chocolate chips.</li>
          <li>
            Cover the mixing bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 to 45
            minutes. Or you can do this ahead and let it chill overnight.
          </li>
          <li>When ready, preheat your over to 350F</li>
          <li>
            Using a small cookie scoop or spoon, take out 3 tablespoons or 1
            cookie scoop full and place it onto a parchment lined baking sheet.
            Space evenly and give 1 to 2 inches of space between each cookie.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cook for 12 minutes, adjust timing if undercooked. Check half way in
            between to see if you need to adjust the timing.
          </li>
          <li>
            At the 6 minute mark, pick the pan up off the rack about 1 inch high
            and drop it onto the rack. This is to prevent the dough from rising
            too much from the baking soda and will pop the bubbles produced by
            it. This ends up making a much denser and chewier cookie without
            making it rubbery.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once done, take them out and wait a few minutes to cool, or don't,
            I'm not the cookie police.
          </li>
