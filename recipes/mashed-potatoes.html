            Yukon Gold potatoes are meticulously peeled and boiled to

            component of this dish, is added generously, delivering an
            unparalleled richness and silkiness. But it is the addition of warm

            ingredients are masterfully combined, and the potatoes are carefully
            mashed until smooth, resulting in a decadent, cloud-like
            consistency. The final touch of salt and white pepper perfectly
            balances the flavors, creating a luxurious symphony of taste. These
            Chef Robuchon style mashed potatoes epitomize French culinary
            finesse and remain a beloved indulgence for food enthusiasts
            worldwide.

            <li>1.5 kg Yukon Gold potatoes</li>
            <li>130 grams unsalted butter</li>
            <li>100ml heavy cream</li>
            <li>300ml whole milk</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>(Optional aromatics)</li>
            <li>Chives</li>
            <li>Bay leaf</li>
            <li>Thyme</li>
            <li>
              Note: you will need a potato ricer or food mill for this dish.

        <ol class="recipe__steps">
          <li>
            Peel the potatoes and throw away the skin. You can peel over a piece
            of parchment paper to reduce the amount of cleanup if desired.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cut your peeled potatoes into cubes of about 1" thickness. Keeping
            every piece around the same will make getting a consistent and
            creamy potato easier when milling the potatoes in a later step.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place the cut potatoes into a large pot of cold water. Season very
            generously in salt. This will pre-season them and also help them
            cook.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bring the pot up to a rapid boil and let them simmer for 15 to 20
            minutes. A good test to know if they're ready is the "fork test".
            Take a fork and poke a potato piece with it while it's in the post.
            If the fork slides in very easily, it's ready. Be sure to not
            overcook them as the final product will be too watery.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the potatoes are done, strain them into a collander and let
            them dry and cool slightly for 1-2 minutes. While they're drying,
            get the potato ricer or food mill
          </li>
          <li>
            Once ready, rice all your potatoes on the finest setting of the
            potato ricer or food mill. This will be the base of your mashed
            potatoes. Place them to the side and keep them warm.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a stove top pot, add the butter on light medium heat to melt it.
            Grate the garlic cloves into the butter mixture as it's melting.
          </li>
          <li>
            Next, add the milk and cream to the mixture, seasonly lightly with
            salt.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add any of your optional aromatics and let them simmer for 1-2
            minutes. Afterwards, strain the mixture or remove and discard any
            aromatics.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cautiously pour the mixtureinto your potatoes to avoid oversaturing
            them. If they seem to be close to being too liquid, don't add any
            more of the mixture. Different potatoes have different starch
            contents and may not stay creamy if you add too much liquid.
          </li>
          <li>
            Taste test; don't be afraid to add seasoning/salt if it's too bland
            to start with.
          </li>
          <li>And with that they're ready to serve.</li>
