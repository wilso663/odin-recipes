      <p>Instructions</p>
      <ol class="recipe__steps">
        <li>Authentic Bolognese sauce starts with a soffrito, so place a large pot on your stove (medium heat), add a generous amount of extra virgin olive oil and once warm, add onion.</li>
        <li>When the onion begins to look glossy and golden, add carrots, celery and then stir through, leaving to cook for 4-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Next add ½ glass red wine (118ml) to the authentic Bolognese sauce and leave to simmer on low for a few minutes or until the wine evaporates.</li>
        <li>Add the mince and break it down using a wooden spoon and/or fork before seasoning with only salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Mix every so often to ensure the mince is all cooked through, leaving to brown.</li>
        <li>Once the water has evaporated, mix in the other half glass of red wine.</li>
        <li>In total, authentic Bolognese sauce should cook for up to 4-5hr and this will make the meat more tender.</li>
        <li>After allowing the wine to evaporate again, mix through the passata, paste and peeled tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Crush tomatoes using the wooden spoon as you stir through.</li>
        <li>After 1.5hr, add 1L/4.2cups boiled water to the pot and mix through. At this point, taste for salt – this is a preference of taste, add only if you want more as no other seasoning is necessary for an authentic Bolognese sauce!</li>
        <li>Then after another hour or so, add more – the trick is when the sauce looks dry, add water, this will thicken the mixture and allow the mince to become more tender.</li>
        <li>Allow the sauce to bubble only a small amount and not spurt everywhere. If it is bubbling too much, turn the heat down.</li>
        <li>When the sauce is 1/2 hr away from being ready, boil 5L water in a second pot then add a tablespoon of rock salt, leaving it to dissolve.</li>
        <li>Once the sauce has been cooking for up to 5hr, remove it from the heat and leave to rest.</li>
        <li>Add your choice of pasta to the water (ours is Pappardelle) and cook according to the packet instructions.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is boiling, prepare a large fry pan for mixing!</li>
        <li>Next add a cup of milk to your sauce and stir through then put it back on the stove for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Finally, place a frypan on the stove at a low heat, and add a generous spoonful (or two!) of Bolognese sauce, covering the base</li>
        <li>Next, add the strained pasta into the pan along with a cup of pasta water.</li>
        <li>Mix this through until the pasta is completely lathered before adding another generous amount of authentic Bolognese sauce and mix again.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
